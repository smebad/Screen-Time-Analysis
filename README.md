📝 Overview:

Screen time data offers valuable insights into how individuals use their devices and engage with apps. This project explores patterns of app usage, the frequency of app openings, and the impact of notifications on user engagement. Through data visualization, statistical analysis, and potential machine learning models, we aim to understand trends and behaviors associated with screen time.

📊 Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Screen Time App Details Dataset, which includes information on app usage, app open frequency, and notifications received over time.


Columns:
* Date: 📅 Date of the app usage.
* App: 📱 Name of the application.
* Usage: ⏰ Amount of time the app was used (in minutes).
* Times opened: 🔁 Number of times the app was opened.
* Notifications: 🔔 Number of notifications received from the app.

🎯 Project Objective
This project aims to:

* 🔍 Explore app usage trends and patterns over time.
* 🔄 Investigate the relationship between app usage, the number of times an app is opened, and the notifications received.
* 📈 Visualize these patterns through interactive and informative charts.
* 💡 Provide insights that could be useful for understanding screen time habits.
* 💻 Skills Demonstrated
 
In this project, the following skills were demonstrated:

* Data Wrangling & Preprocessing: 🧹 Cleaning, transforming, and organizing data for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 📊 Summarizing the data using descriptive statistics and exploring relationships between features.
* Data Visualization: 🎨 Creating interactive visualizations using Plotly to explore app usage, open frequency, and notifications.
* Correlation Analysis: 🔗 Investigating the relationship between different variables to draw meaningful insights.
* Trend Analysis: 📆 Analyzing time-based patterns in app usage and identifying key trends.
  
🛠️ Tools and Libraries:

The following tools and libraries were used to complete this analysis:
